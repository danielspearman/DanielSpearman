Coopersmith, J. (2016). _Faxed: The rise and fall of the fax machine_. Johns Hopkins University Press. 

### Summary

In this chapter, Coopersmith dives into the early days of the fax machine. He takes a deep dive into the shortcomings of many inventors and why their invention was unsuccesful. Overall an interesting read, seeing how inventor after inventor attempted to create the fax machine.

“The world’s oldest fax message sits in the quiet archives of the Institution of Engineering and Technology at 2 Savoy Place in London, carefully preserved in a non-acidic envelope. The white lines on a blue background are still sharp since more than 160 years ago when Frederick Bakewell dipped the paper in prussiate of potash and a stylus traced distinct letters on the 1 × 12 -inch slip.” (Coopersmith,9) [[2023-03-01]]

-   My guess for the first fax machine was way off, way earlier than I would’ve expected

short-lived. Customers valued easy and inexpensive transmission of a message above its authoritative and authentic visual reproduction. (Coopersmith,10) [[2023-03-01]]

-   Interesting that the customers valued the price over quality, understandable, but surely there was many who prefered more accurate faxes

Poor and unschooled, he educated himself, learning about electricity from public lectures.  
(Coopersmith,11) [[2023-03-01]]

-   Really cool fact, super impressive to get to where he did without traditional schooling

“Bain received large amounts of money but lost it in unsuccessful litigation and died a pauper.” (Coopersmith,11) [[2023-03-01]]

-   Sad ending to a cool story with a meteoric rise
    
    “At one time, a third of the telegraph lines in the United States used Bain’s system, but the legal triumph of Morse’s system banished Bain into semi-obscurity.”
    
    (Coopersmith,12) [[2023-03-01]]
    
-   I assume Morse had patents compared to Bain not being able to achieve that.
    
    “In January 1830 , he walked 19 kilometers to attend a lecture on “the electric fluid.”” (Coopersmith,12) [[2023-03-01]]  
    
-   The efforts he made to learn are truly admriable
    
    “Bain received patents in 1840 and 1841 for applying electricity to clocks, signals, printing and railroads.”  (Coopersmith,12) [[2023-03-01]]
    
-   Are the electrical clocks from this time similar to the ones of today, or were they far off?
    
    “ In his obsession with receiving appropriate recognition, Bain followed the path of too many independent inventors to the detriment of his commercial success.” (Coopersmith,14) [[2023-03-02]]
    
-   Interesting, would like to know who else had this issue.
    
    “Bain actually developed two fax machines, his unbuilt 1843 model and a much improved version a few years later.”  (Coopersmith,14) [[2023-03-02]
    
-   Unbuilt? meaning he had made developed the building plan but never built it?
    
    “Having a technology that works is not enough to succeed commercially. Inventors often need patrons whose approval can provide resources and legitimacy.”
    
    (Coopersmith,20) [[2023-03-03]]
    
-   I would say this is true to this day, while it’s easier with the internet, you still need credibility  
    
    ““the picture was considerably interrupted by messages traveling the same course, and had dots and dashes all over it, but was nevertheless recognizable.””  
    (Coopersmith,20) [[2023-03-03]]
    
-   I wonder how long it took to fix this issue, also who was sending telegraphs?

“ At 20 centimes per square centimeter, a message cost at least 6 francs plus another 6 to 24 francs for the metallic sheet.” (Coopersmith,23) [[2023-03-03]]

-   I’m going to look into how much francs are compared to CAD
    
    “By any criteria, regular telegraphy clearly trumped fax.”  
    (Coopersmith,27) [[2023-03-03]]
    
-   Thinking back to my grade 10 history class, telegraphs were the dominant method of communication during WWI
