## Summary and Key Takeaways
Vannevar Bush predicts what he believes the future of science and technology will look like. In these predictions, he is wildly accurate. Bush also introduces the idea of the memex, a new way to store information.

## Annotations


“He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. “  Page 1 [[2023-2-6]]_

-Were scientists easily able to return to their normal work following the war, or did they have a sense of guilt for their actions? Page 1 _[[2023-2-6]]_

“For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.” Page 1 _[[2023-2-6]]_  

-I am going under the assumption he is referring to medical scientists continuing to heal and focus on other health

“It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments.” Page 1 _[[2023-2-6]]_

-Answers my earlier question, I assume there was more money working for the military

“Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper.” Page 2 _[[2023-2-6]]_

-   Was this an issue with them not believing in the accuracy of the calculator? Surely this decision led to many miscalculations caused by human error.

“At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown.” Page 3 _[[2023-2-6]]_

Did anything ever come of this machine? was it well received at the world fair?

“Machines have been made which will read typed figures by photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.” Page 3 _[[2023-2-6]]_

-   I was unaware that the level of technology at this time was so advanced

“The needs of business and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.”

Page 4 _[[2023-2-6]]_

-   Answers my earlier question, calculators were wanted but it came down to production 

“With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of manipulating data are a very small part of the population.”

-   True, at the time less people were in school and those in school only did simple math, calculators were not required.

The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.

-   The idea of digitizing records and making them easier to find rather than searching through hundreds of paper documents
