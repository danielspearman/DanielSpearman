### Summary 
Building off my last article, this article shows new advancements from WWI to WWII. The main change was the use of mobile radio, allowed communication for soldiers in tanks and away from base. Still left to be desired was long distance communication, while some strides were made, still not as much as was wanted.


### Annotations

“In communications [electronics](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electronics), [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II) was in one sense similar to World War I”

-   Kind of figured, assumed same technology just much more polished with fewer issues

“Portable radio sets were provided as far down in the military [echelons](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/echelons) as the platoon”

[[2023-03-03]

-   I want to say this is new, portable radios weren’t mentioned previously

“ With these sets telegraph communication could be conducted at distances of more than 100 miles (160 kilometres) with vehicles in normal motion on the road.”

-   Pretty impressive, although im sure it left a bit to be desired

“Radio relay, born of the necessity for [mobility](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/mobility), became the outstanding communication development of World War II.”

-   Replacing telephones and telegraphs, I assume?

“The need for communication between the homelands and many far-flung theatres of war gave rise to the need for improved long-range overseas communication systems.”

-   Said this in a earlier annotation

“Among the major applications are monitoring electric-power plants, gathering meteorological data, and monitoring manned and unmanned space flights.”

[[2023-03-03]]

-   Space flights, how is that relevant to WWI

“The original telemetry systems were termed [supervisory](https://www.britannica.com/technology/supervisory-control) because they were used to monitor [electric power](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-power) distribution.”

-   Really cool actually, were they used to see where enemies could potentially be setting up base?
