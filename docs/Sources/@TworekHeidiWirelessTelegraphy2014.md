### Summary and Key Thoughts
This article goes farther in-depth about the telegraph and its importance during WWI. The article also looks into both the allies and the axis and their thoughts on the wireless telegraph. Interesting to see the skepticism surounding the telegraph.


### Annotations

“It created new spaces for communications at sea and in the air as well as the ability to coordinate mobile units during battle.”

-   Is this saying that the telegraph was handheld, or are they saying that mobile units could set up base and then use the telegraph?

“All ninety German warships were equipped with wireless in 1909; in 1912, the former first sea lord, Admiral Sir [John Fisher (1841–1920)](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/index/names/118683756 "John Fisher (1841-1920)"), called wireless “the pith and marrow of war!””

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Did this give the Germans a large advantage in the war?

“Germans focused more heavily than other countries on employing wireless in multiple arenas, though other combatants used wireless extensively by 1917–1918. More broadly, wireless telegraphy was a key technology that globalized conflict both militarily and through news.”

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Is there a reason for this? were the Germans technologically ahead of other countires? or did they just value the telegraph more heavily than others?

“Aside from its naval purposes, wireless enabled [governments](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/governments_parliaments_and_parties "Governments, Parliaments and Parties") to reach their colonies without using [Britain’s](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/great_britain "Great Britain") “All Red Line” of [submarine](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/submarines_and_submarine_warfare "Submarines and Submarine Warfare") telegraph cables around the world.”

-   I’d like to further into this, I’ve never heard of it

“When war broke out, these wireless-equipped areas became priorities for Allied forces.”

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Did they have prior knowledge of the Germans setting up wireless communication in these regions?

“At the battle of Bitapaka on 11 September 1914, Australian forces attacked a German wireless station on the island of New Britain, conquering German New Guinea.”

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Never heard of this battle, I assume because I learned WWI from a Canadian bias and therefore this battle wasn’t mentioned

“ By October 1914, the British had destroyed German wireless stations on the strategically important island of Yap, and by early 1915 in [southwest Africa](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/southern_africa "Southern Africa"). In east Africa, a British wireless installation at Mombasa intercepted German wireless from Lake Victoria until June 1915 or later.”

-   Pretty cool that telegraph stations become major targets of the allies, shows how important they were to military success

“In 1914, armies remained as skeptical about wireless as navies were enthusiastic. All armies searched for secure methods of communications; wireless could be easily intercepted.”

[[2023-03-06]]

-   So why didn’t this concern the navies?

“The German military embraced the possibilities of wireless widely, supplying every army headquarters and [cavalry](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/cavalry "Cavalry") division with wireless. “

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Did the Germans have a way to stop their wireless from being intercepted

“Moreover, the Allied [naval blockade](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/naval_blockade_of_germany "Naval Blockade (of Germany)") from 1916 restricted German supplies of [raw materials](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/raw_materials "Raw Materials") like copper to create telephone cables.” [[2023-03-06]]

-   Always interesting to see the different strategies the military has, and how the opponent works through it

“. The British relied more upon telephones during the initial years of trench warfare, as well as visual signaling through flags, lamps, and heliograph.” [[2023-03-06]]

-   Were telephones harder to intercept?

“Though the German Imperial Navy used a codebook to prevent interception of its own messages, the British already possessed a copy when the war broke out.” [[2023-03-06]]

-   How did the British obtain this?

“Although the British War Office initially rejected investment in airborne wireless, by 1917, airborne valve wireless played a vital role in spotting artillery and enabling ground-to-air communications.”

[[2023-03-06]]

-   Did they think it was too expensive?
