## Summary and Key Take Aways

This article entails the history and the makings of the Voder, it answered my question as to whether or not the Voder came to anything. The article also describes how the Voder was demonstrated.


## Annotations
“However, Werner Meyer-Eppler, then the director of Phonetics at Bonn University, recognised the relevance of the machines to electronic music after Dudley visited the University in 1948, and used the vocoder as a basis for his future writings which in turn became the inspiration for the German “Electronische Musik” movement.” _[[2023-2-6]]_

-   Interesting that the voder became the basis of a ever popular music genre to this day

“In the New York Fair demonstration, which was repeated frequently, the announcer gave a simple running discussion of the circuit to which the girl operator replied through the Voder. This was done by manipulating fourteen keys with the fingers, a bar with the left wrist and a foot pedal with the right foot.” _[[2023-2-6]]_

-   Very interesting way to show the Voder’s capability
