## Summary and Key Takeaways
Caulfield describes a new tool hes found to love, federated wikis, a new way to gather your thoughts and organize them in an effective manner. He promotes the tool and offers solutions in the scholary world. 

## Annotations 



“But for the past year I’ve been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki. And it’s radically changed how I think about online communication and collaboration”[[2023-2-8]]

-   Term I’ve never heard of

“Without going to much into what my federated wiki journal is, just imagine that instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew.” [[2023-2-8]]

-   Seems similar to a public memex, a collection of your thinkings and notes.

The first thing I do is “de-stream” the article. [[2023-2-8]]

-   The same as us citing our articles

“I want to make a home page for this idea or fact. My hub for thinking about this. So I make a page like so:”

[[2023-2-8]]

-   Similar to the graph feature on obsidian where you can show your main idea and then have notes on sub topics of the main idea

“When I come back I see this page and I think, you know what would make this page better? A link to the actual study. So  I spend a couple more minutes and track down the actual paper and add it.”

[[2023-2-8]]

-   I question the impact of the federated wiki, does it have more quality than a simple tweet? sure, but its outreach is much smaller

“This punctures my simple story where more guns = more suicides because the truth is that western states full of White males are going to tend to have both more gun ownership and more suicide.”

[[2023-2-9]]

-   I disagree, I dont think the higher suicide rate has to do with easier to access guns

“I have close to 1,000 articles in my personal wiki at this point. I have maybe 1,000 more scattered on other sites. They are from myself and others, most simple summaries of ideas I encounter, or data, or examples of ideas. Some are the result of afternoon-long rainy Saturday coffee shop investigations, but most are like what I have just showed you here, simple knowledge that builds complexity through linking.” [[2023-2-9]]

-   This is why I disagree with the personal wiki, no body is going to go through all these articles, a tweet that collects these thoughts from your personal wiki has much more outreach and effectiveness.

“Over time these things you write up start to form a deep network that helps you think. “ [[2023-2-9]]

-   This is where I can agree with Caulfield, the personal Wiki is great for storing your work and connecting different pieces you’ve worked on

“I’m going to assume most people in the room here have read Vannevar Bush’s 1945 essay As We May Think. If you haven’t read it yet, you need to.”

[[2023-2-9]]

-   Previous reading, probably talks about Bush’s memex

“He talks there about a machine he envisions called the Memex:” [[2023-2-9]]

-   I was correct

“Your machine is a library not a publication device. You have copies of documents is there that you control directly, that you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with.”

[[2023-2-9]]

-   Slight difference between federated wiki and memex

“There’s about 31,000 active wikipedians that hold English Wikipedia together. That’s about the population of Stanford University, students, faculty and staff combined, for the entire English speaking world.”

[[2023-2-9]]

-   Doesn’t seem like a wildly small figure, depends on each workers output I guess

“Let me give you a simple example — we just mentioned the OER problem, right? Nobody can find good OER on certain subjects. But imagine a world where you write an article named Subsidies and Local Government in WordPress, and that pings a notifier that indexes that page. And immediately you are notified of all pages named this, and presented with a list of pages those pages link to.”

[[2023-2-9]]

-   Seems like wikis are more for scholars and educators rather than the average person, confused as to why he chose to use twitter as a comparison. Which is more for casual use and easy to get information
