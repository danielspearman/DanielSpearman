### Summary
An article that shows many ways of the military was able to communicate during WWI. Interesting read as it shows both technological ways that we've discussed in class aswell as simpler ways that have been used for a very long time. Says that radio, telephone and telegraphs were the most prominent.

### Annotations

“From the very beginnings of military warfare communication often holds the keys to victory”

-   This interests me into looking communication before WWI and see if they only communicated via letters
    

“ For the first time, much of the world was using electricity, and this new source of power was utilized for communication in the form of telegraphs, telephones, signal lamps, and radio”

-   Answers my previous question
    

“Weather, terrain, and the enemy could break the electric lines that connected the Marines to their commanders”

-   I feel like this was a major strategy during the war for both sides
    

“Signal flags are a uniform set of easily identifiable nautical codes used to convey visual messages and signals between two ships or from ship to shore”

[[2023-03-03]]

-   Were these signalsuniversally known, or were they different depending on who was sending them
    

“During the French Revolution in 1792, Claude Chappe invented the semaphore line system. This was a method of communication using a series of visual signals and rotating paddles. The message was encoded by the position of the paddles. The message can then be read when the paddles are in a fixed position”

-   I assume that there were classes taught to soldiers to ensure they had a strong grasp of this
    

“Similar to Chappe’s semaphore system, semaphore is a form of signaling used by the U.S. Navy, but instead of using signal flags that are hoisted far overhead, visual signals are conveyed with hand-held flags or colored paddles.”

-   I thought technology was more prominent in WWI, maybe later in the article
    

“The electric telegraph sends an electric current to a receiving station. When the sender presses on the telegraph key he interrupts the current creating an audible pulse that is heard at the receiving station. It cannot carry voice or other data, and relies only on pulses to communicate.”

-   I always find it impressive that they were able to communicate like this during the heat of war
    

“While it is often thought it means “save our ship”, it actually does not stand for anything”

[[2023-03-03]]

-   I never knew this, I also always thought it mean “Save our souls”
    

“During WWI, on the Western Front, telephones were used to communicate between the front line Marines and Soldiers and their commanders”

[[2023-03-03]]

-   I was unaware of this, were phones standard issue, or were the rather rare?
    

“The U.S. Army Signal Corps constructed 2,000 miles of telegraph and telephone pole lines using 28,000 miles of wire, and 32,000 miles of French communication poles.”

-   Really wonder how much this cost them, at the time I assume this was expensive technology.
    

“. For example the word “Marine” would be “Mike Alfa Romeo India November Echo when spelled out in the current phonetic alphabet.”

-   Was audio quality so poor that this was necessary, could take ages to communicate
