### Summary 
A simple article that gives readers the main differences between fax and telegram. Lays out how fax   is used for images and text and uses a printer to transmit its message. While telegraphs needed to be encoded by both sender and receiver.


### Annotations

“The main difference between Telegram and Fax is that the Telegram is a long distance transmission of textual/symbolic messages without the physical exchange of an object and Fax is a method of transmitting images, often of documents.”

-   Needed more clarification following the Coopersmith book. [[@CoopersmithJonathanTheRiseAndFallOfTheFaxMachine2015]]

“Telegraphy (from Greek: τῆλε têle, “at a distance” and γράφειν gráphein, “to write”) is the long-distance transmission of textual or symbolic (as opposed to verbal or audio) messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message. Thus semaphore is a method of telegraphy, whereas pigeon post is not.”

-   This is where my confusion stemmed from, awfully similar

“Telegraphy requires that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according to the limits of the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples.”

-   I feel like the code encoding was a huge reasoning for the telegraphs popularity during WWI

“Fax (short for facsimile), sometimes called telecopying or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device.”

-   In the earlier description of the difference, it did not mention the text part of faxes, it caused confusion.
