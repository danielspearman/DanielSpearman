## Summary and Key Takeaways
This short article describes Leibniz's journey in creating the calculator and how it was different from other machines similar at the the time, mianly because it used decimals. 

## Annotations

“Instead, the Step Reckoner represented numbers in decimal form, as positions on 10-position dials. Even decimal representation was not a given: in 1668 Samuel Morland invented an adding machine specialized for British money—a decidedly non-decimal system.” _[[2023-2-6]]_

Was the decimal system not a widely understood concept at the time? or were whole numbers simply preffered?
